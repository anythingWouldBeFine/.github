# Welcome to AnythingWouldBeFine
## Mission
We aim to improve productivity and reduce internet addiction through positive reinforcement, ensuring users complete personalized tasks before accessing online media content. 

## About the Project
AnythingWouldBeFine is a platform that connects task achievement with access to social media content. Users can sign up or log into any Mastodon server instance where they can link their professional tasks — such as coding on GitHub, designing on Canva, or solving problems on LeetCode — with their social media usage.

## Task-Based Access System
### Authentication
- Users can sign up and log into any instance of a Mastodon server using their credentials.
- Users can link to other professional accounts to enable accurate data on task completion.
- Users can log into the extension to enable accurate data on task completion.

### Permissions
- OAuth grants scoped permissions, meaning we get access to only specific data that can be viewed by the user and opted out from.
- Users have control over what information we can access.
- There will be a clear list of information collected on the extension.
- All code will be open-source and transparent to ensure clear communication of what we have access to.

### Task Management
- Users can select tasks specific to their profession.
- Users can choose the intensity of their tasks (how much effort needs to be kept for social media access).
- Task completion is tracked to unlock access to online media content.

### API Integration
- We leverage APIs to fetch content from Mastadon
- We use OAuth and third-party servers to gain information for task completion

# Phases
## Phase 1: App
We plan to have a website and app for users to log in with a dashboard, and an interface for online media content

## Phase 2: Extension and Background App
We plan on developing an extension and a possible way to track the completion of tasks both with consent and open-source code

## Phase 3: Dedicated Mastodon Server
After getting the system running or securing enough funds we will create our mastodon instance with the hope of it being a haven to share personal growth, discuss bugs and feature requests, and redefine what social media should be used for

## Phase 4: Expansion
The moment there is a level of stability and we have enough user feedback we will slowly add more tasks and technology for detecting tasks while updating our code and ensuring there is descriptive documentation and changelog for easy onboarding
