# Welcome to AnythingWouldBeFine
## Mission
We aim to improve productivity and reduce internet addiction through positive reinforcement, ensuring users complete personalized tasks before accessing online media content. 

## About the Project
AnythingWouldBeFine is a platform that connects task achievement with access to social media content. Users can sign up or log into any Mastodon server instance where they can link their professional tasks — such as coding on GitHub, designing on Canva, or solving problems on LeetCode — with their social media usage.

## Task-Based Access System
### Authentication
- Users can sign up and log into any instance of a Mastodon server using their credentials.
- Users can link to other professional accounts to enable accurate data on tasks completion.
- Users can log into the extension to enable accurate data on tasks completion.

### Permissions
- OAuth grants scoped permissions, meaning the client we get access to only specific data.
- Users have control over what information we can access.
- There will be a clear list of what information is collected on the extension.
- All code will be open-source and transparent to ensure clear communication of what we have access to.

### Task Management
- Users can select tasks specific to their profession.
- Users can choose the intensity of their tasks (how much effort needs to be kept for social media access).
- Task completion is tracked to unlock access to online media content.

### API Integration
- We leverage APIs to fetch content from Mastadon
- We use OAuth and third-party servers to gain information for task completion

# Phases
## Phase 1: App
Our plan is to have a website and app for users to login with a dashboard, and an interface for online media content

## Phase 2: Extension and Background App
We plan on developing an extension and a possible way to get the completion of tasks both with consent and open-source code

## Phase 3: Dedicated Mastadon Server
After getting the system running or securing enough funds we will create our mastadon instance with the hope of it being a safe haven to share personal growth, discuss about bugs and feature requests and redefine what social media should be used for

# Open Source Contribution
This project is open source, and we welcome contributions from developers, designers, psychologists, and any enthusiast.
